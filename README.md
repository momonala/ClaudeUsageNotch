**NOTCHY** is a free, open-source macOS utility that turns the MacBook's hardware notch into a real-time Claude usage monitor. A minimal pill blends seamlessly with the notch — hover to expand into a full panel with session %, weekly quota, time until reset, and threshold alerts. Everything runs locally with zero telemetry.

---

## What it looks like

- **Compact pill** — sits inside the notch like a Dynamic Island element. Colour-coded glow shows health at a glance.
- **Expanded panel** — drops down on hover or click. Shows your session percentage big, a rolling counter animation, session + weekly cards, and a mood-reactive retro mascot (calm → worried → alarmed).
- **Notifications** — in-app banners at 25 / 50 / 75 / 90% usage. No system permission required.

## Features

- Dynamic Island-style pill that blends with the physical hardware notch
- Arc progress ring with colour-matched glow (green → amber → red)
- Mood-reactive retro mascot — calm at 0–74%, worried at 75–89%, alarmed at 90%+
- Hover to expand / click to pin — click anywhere outside to dismiss
- Hero layout — giant usage %, reset countdown, rolling counter on open
- Session card (5-hour window) + weekly card (7-day quota)
- In-app banners at 25 / 50 / 75 / 90% (no system permission required)
- Right-click context menu — Refresh · Settings · Test notification · Quit
- 5-minute auto-refresh with exponential backoff on errors
- Cookie stored in macOS Keychain — never in UserDefaults, never logged
- Local-first — talks only to `claude.ai`, zero telemetry
- Provider-extensible — clean `UsageProvider` protocol, Gemini stub included
- MIT licensed — read every line yourself

## Requirements

| | Minimum |
|---|---|
| macOS | 12.0 Monterey |
| Chip | Apple Silicon (arm64) |
| Xcode CLT | Any version with Swift 5.9+ |
| Xcode (full) | Optional — only for Mode B build |

> **Intel Mac:** Change `-target arm64-apple-macosx12.0` to `-target x86_64-apple-macosx12.0` in `scripts/build.sh`.

---

## Install

### Option A — Build from source (no Xcode required)

```bash
# 1. Install Xcode Command Line Tools (one-time)
xcode-select --install

# 2. Clone
git clone https://github.com/I-N-SILVA/NOTCHY.git
cd NOTCHY/swift-project/NotchyLimit

# 3. Build
bash scripts/build.sh

# 4. Run
open build/NotchyLimit.app
```

The script compiles with `swiftc`, assembles the `.app` bundle, generates the `.icns` icon from included PNGs, and strips the quarantine attribute. No full Xcode install, no code signing, no Apple developer account required.

### Option B — With Xcode (for development)

```bash
brew install xcodegen
cd NOTCHY/swift-project/NotchyLimit
xcodegen generate
open NotchyLimit.xcodeproj   # then ⌘R
```

## First launch — getting your Claude cookie

Notchy reads Claude's internal usage endpoint using your session cookie.

1. Open [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) and log in
2. Open DevTools (`⌘ + ⌥ + I`) → **Network** tab
3. Refresh the page and find a request to `usage`
4. Under **Request Headers**, copy the entire `Cookie` value
5. Paste it into Notchy's onboarding screen → **Validate**

The cookie is stored in the macOS **Keychain** — never on disk, never logged.

> **Note:** This uses an undocumented Claude endpoint that may change. If it breaks, open an [Issue](https://github.com/I-N-SILVA/NOTCHY/issues).

---

## Usage

| Action | Result |
|---|---|
| Hover over the notch pill | Expands to full panel |
| Click the pill | Pins panel open |
| Click outside the panel | Collapses to pill |
| Press Escape | Collapses to pill |
| Right-click the pill | Context menu: Refresh · Settings · Quit |

### How the notch blend works

The panel anchors at `screen.frame.maxY` with height = `safeAreaInsets.top` (hardware notch, ~37 pt) + visible content. The top portion sits inside the physical camera housing — black blends with hardware. Only the lower portion is visible, identical to iOS Dynamic Island.

## Privacy

- Cookie stored in macOS **Keychain** — never in UserDefaults, never logged
- No telemetry, no analytics, no remote servers
- Network calls go only to `claude.ai` (and whichever providers you configure)
- MIT licensed — read every line yourself

---

## Contributing

PRs welcome. Good first issues:

- **Gemini provider** — stub is in place, needs a real implementation
- **ChatGPT provider** — OpenAI usage API integration
- **Intel build** — verify and document x86_64 target
- **Sparkle auto-update** — add `Sparkle.framework` update checking
- **Cookie helper** — browser extension to auto-grab the cookie

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](swift-project/NotchyLimit/CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.
